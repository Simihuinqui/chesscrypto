k Welcome to Knackie's Tactics Training. The examples are based on material of a Hungarian Chess School. They have been revised using Fritz and a bit of Knackie's brain.
15
k The 4th Lesson features the theme 'King in the centre'.
10
k In the middlegame, a king in the centre is, of course, subject to sharp attacks.
15
k The attacking side should not fear making big sacrifices to hold the king in the centre; mate will be almost inevitable.
15
k Let's start with a famous example:
8
k Example 1: Lilienthal vs Capablanca, Hastings 1934
3
bsetup

bsetup fen 2r1k2r/2pn1pp1/1p3n1p/p3PP2/4q2B/P1P5/2Q1N1PP/R4RK1

1
bname Capablanca
1
k Capablanca was considered an unbeatable chess machine (an ancestor of Deep Blue)
15
k Watch how Lilienthal sacrified his queen to hold Capablanca's king in the centre, scoring a sensational win:
30
e5f6
e4c2
f6g7
k That was Lilienthal's idea. This pawn not only attacks black's rook but it also prevents black's king from escaping out of the centre via f8.
20
h8g8
e2d4
k Black must play Qe4, giving back the queen. Let's look what happens if he plays Qxc3 instead:
15
c2c3
a1e1
d7e5
e1e5
e8d7
e5e7
d7d6
d4b5
k Winning the queen.

k Let's now look at the game continuation:

c2e4
a1e1
d7c5
e1e4
c5e4
f1e1
g8g7

k Bishop+knight vs rook guarantee an easy win.

1
k White threatens BxBg7 followed by Qxh7+. How did Black reverse the situation?
15
k 75 seconds...
75
f6e4
k When the centre is open, the white king is helpless...
10
f3e4
k How does black open the position around white's king still further?
15
g7d4
k If white now plays BxRf8, he will soon be mated by Qxc3, etc., so he takes the bishop.
12
c3d4
b2d4
k The white King cannot escape: if he moves to e2 black plays Bxg4+ followed by Qxc2, whereas if he moves to the first row there comes Qxa1 etc.
30
k Example 3: Tapaszto vs Kossik, Budapest 1951

bsetup fen rn2kb1r/p3pppp/b7/1p1qN3/2pP4/2P1PP2/6PP/1RBQKB1R

k In this position both kings are still in the centre, but neither side has launched an attack yet. How can white start an attack?
15
k 75 seconds...
75
f1c4
b5c4
d1a4
k If black now plays Nb8-d7 there comes NxNd7! Qxd7 QxBa6 when white quickly develops with 0-0, whereas the black king remains in the centre.
25
k So black has no choice...
10
e8d8
k White would like to exploit the loose position of black's piece, but RxNb8 RxRb8 QxBa6 Rb8-B1 is unclear. How can white improve on this?
35
e3e4
k This opens a diagonal for white's bishop.

d5e6
b1b8
a8b8
e5c6
d8c7
c1f4

k Winning easily, e.g. KxNc6 d4-d5 +-

k In this example we've almost reached the endgame. How does white exploit the central position of black's king?
20
k 75 seconds...
75
e4e5
d6c5
f4f6
e6d7
e5e6
k Winning the rook at e7. The e-pawn has done a fine job.

1
k In this position white must play with great energy, as black threatens Bxh2+ with mate to follow.
20
k 75 seconds...
75
e1e7
k White forces the king to the open. Let's first look what happens if black recaptures with the Bishop:
15
d6e7
a5d5
k White now has time for this simple move, as black doesn't threaten mate on h2 anymore.
10
a8d8
d5f7
e8d7
a1e1
h8e8
c4e6
d7c6
e6h3
k So capturing with the bishop was bad. Let's now look at the game:
back 10
e8e7
a1e1
k Black played Kf8 here, so let's first look what happens if black plays Be5 instead:
15
d6e5
e1e5
k In the open position, the black king is helpless.

f6e5
a5e5
e7d7
e5d5
d7c7
d2a5
c7b8
d5d6
b8b7
d6c7
k So Be5 didn't help. Let's look at the game:
10
back 12
e7f8
k Black still threatens Bxh2, but white has a powerful reply...
35
d2f4
k Very strong!! Black cannot capture the Bishop because the white Queen then gives check on c5, with mate.
25
g7g6
a5d5
k White threatens Qf7 mate and attacks the Ra8 and the Bd6, which is a bit too much for the defense...
25
k Example 6: Sibarevic vs Bukic, Banja Luka 1976

k White has sacrified a piece for a big development advantage, but the centre is still closed. How can white reach the black king?
25
k 75 seconds...
75
e1e5
k That looks good! But it needs some calculation...
15
k Let's look at the easiest variation first:
10
d7e5
k well..., what would you play?
15
d5f6
k Oh! that that was quick! Let's go back:
back 2
5
d6e5
k This should cause no problem either...
20
d5f6
d7f6
d1d8
k Surprisingly, mate does not come on the e-file, but on the d-file. Let's go back to the game:
15

1
k Black has sacrified a piece for the attack. He would like to play Nf4-h3, threatening Qg1 mate, but black then escapes with e2-e3 Qg1+ Ke2.
20
k This is a kind of anti-example to our theme. The question is: How can black prevent the white king escaping to the centre?
15
k 75 seconds...
75
e8e3
k Very nice! white now has no defense against the simple Nf4-h3 followed by Qg1 mate

k The Bishop h7 nicely prevents the black king from escaping to the corner, but how can white attack?
15
k White could try to find a way to attack f7 with his queen, but how could he achieve this?
15
k 75 seconds...
75
b1f5
k White attacks f7. Simple isn't it? The Queen cannot be captured:
15
e6f5
k There follows...
8
e5d7
k mate. So let's go back to the game:
10
back 2
5
d6e5
k What is the drawback of this defense?
20
b2a3
f8e8
f5e5
k Black resigned in view of the numerous threats: Qe5-d6-e7 mate, or Qe5-g7-f8, or simply QxNf4.

k The position of black's king looks quite secure here. How would you launch an attack in the middle? (Some calculation is needed here)
20
k 90 seconds...
90
d4e6
k A typical sacrifice.
10
f7e6
d3g6
k Black cannot play Kf8 here, as white then plays Qe6 followed by Qf7 mate.
15
e8d8
h3e6
b5b4
f4e5
f6g8
k How can the rook at h1 participate?
h1f1
k Very strong! White threatens Rf8 mate.
20
c7c6
k Should white be impressed by black's queen?
20
d1d6
e7h4
k White could take black's queen here, but that would not be enough for such a nice position.
30
f1f8
d8c7
k The finish is easy...

1
k In the final example we will see how a World Champion uses the 'king in the centre' theme.
20
k At first sight it seems impossible to prevent black from castling next move. Show some imagination like Aljechin...
20
k 90 seconds...
90
a1a6
k That looks strange...
10
b6a6
c2c5
k That was Aljechin's idea: the Queen prevents the black king from castling and threatens Qxe5+.
15
a6e6
g2c6
k Black played Nf6-d7 here; Kd8 is no better:
10
e8d8
c1d2
k The second bishop comes into action...

b5b4
c5a5
d8e7
d2b4
b8b4
a5b4
e6d6
b4b7
e7e6
c6a4
k White now threatens Ba4-b3+ followed by Qxf7.
15
f6d5
a4b3
h8d8
e2e4
k Winning the knight. Let's now look at the game:
10
back 16
5
f6d7
c6d7
k Black cannot recapture with the Queen, as after Qe6xd7 Qc5xe5+, white wins the rook at b8.
20
e8d7
c5a7
k On Kc8, white would answer Bc1-d2 followed by Rc1+.
15
d7c6
c1d2
h8c8
k How does Aljechin take more squares away from the black king?
30
e2e4
k Very strong!
8
e6b3
k How does Aljechin bring his rook into action?
30
d1a1
b5b4
a1a6
c6b5
a6a5
b5c6
a7c5
c6d7
a5a7
k Mate follows. This was a very typical example:
10
k White first played energetically to prevent the black king from castling (sacrifice Ra6!)
15
k Play then slowed down and Aljechin took his time to activate his pieces (Bc1-d2), and took away squares from the king (e2-e4!)
15
k The black king in the centre proved a LONG TERM ADVANTAGE for white; there was no need to look for a quick mate.
15

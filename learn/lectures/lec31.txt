k This lecture is an edited version of a transcript of a live lecture given by Grandmaster Milorad Knezevic (FICS handle Knez) on April 15, 1999.
10
k Many extraneous comments were eliminated, and the order in which some comments appear were changed so that they appear right before or after the move(s) being discussed.
15
k For consistency, all moves within kibitzes and whispers were changed to standard algebraic notation.
8
k Spelling errors were fixed. Punctuation and grammar were only fixed when what was being said was difficult to understand otherwise.
12
k Now, on with the show :)
k GM Knezevic: hi
k GM Knezevic: the main idea of our lecture today is open lines as strategic element
8
k GM Knezevic: experienced players perfectly know the meaning of open lines in chess game
8
k GM Knezevic: in general their main use should be the ways to infiltrate in opponent's camp
k GM Knezevic: but apart from the abstract meaning of open line , we must find some moment supporting its use , for example better coordination of pieces , more space and so on
17
k GM Knezevic: I will start showing my game against GM Kypreichic , played in Czechoslovakia 1975

Re2
k GM Knezevic: Re2! Now you will see the main way of using open line : Occupy it with both rooks , come to 7th or 8th rank and try to finish game in direct attack
16
k GM Knezevic: Of course such things do not happen often , just in the case as here when everything works in our favor!

8
k GM Knezevic: but it is anywhere good to know technique of occupying one of last ranks
8

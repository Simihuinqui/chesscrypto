k The line I will show you in this lecture comes from "Mastering the French With the Read and Play Method", Page 19.
10
k What I am going to give are my annotations to the moves in the line given.
8
e2e4
2
e7e6
2
k This is the French Defense.
8
d2d4
2
d7d5
2
e4e5
2
k This is the advance variation.
8
c7c5
2
k The first thing black should do in the advance variation is put pressure on White's d-pawn.
8
c2c3
2
k White adds protection to his d-pawn.
8
b8c6
2
k Black develops a piece, and adds another attacker on the d-pawn.
8
g1f3
2
k White also develops a piece, and adds a guard to his d-pawn.
8
d8b6
2
k Black develops another piece, and adds yet another attacker on the d-pawn.
8
f1d3
4
k This is the Milner-Barry Gambit.  Other options for white include 6. Be2 and 6. a3.
8
k Here, White blocks the queen from guarding the d-pawn, and now black can win the pawn.
8
k The idea being that white tries for a lead in development while black is busy taking the pawn.
8
c5d4
4
k Black starts off by trading pawns.
8
c3d4
4
k White takes the pawn back.
8
k Right here, there is a very common trap that Black can fall into.
8
c6d4
4
k This move is horrible; here's why:
8
f3d4
2
b6d4
4
k So far, this is what black expected.  It looks like black won a pawn, however ...
8
d3b5
k This move puts Black in check, and White has a discovered attack and wins the black queen.
8
k Therefore, black must do something first to avoid this check.  Let's go back and find an answer.
8
back 4
4
k Instead, black should play ...
8
c8d7
4
k This move removes White's ability to check Black's king with Bb5.
8
e1g1
4
k Again, White doesn't worry about the d-pawn, and tries for a lead in development.
8
c6d4
4
k Here is where Black eats the pawn.
8
f3d4
4
b6d4
4
k Notice that now, Bb5 is no longer a check move, so White can't win Black's queen here.
8
k Both 10. Qe2 f6! and 10. Re1 Ne7 11. Nc3 a6 give Black a slight advantage.
8
b1c3
4
k Out of all White's Choices, this one is best.
8
d4e5
4
k Black eats another pawn, but White will soon get one back.
8
f1e1
4
k White attacks Black's queen.
8
e5b8
4
k This is the safest place for Black's queen.
8
c3d5
4
k White gets a pawn back.  Black can't capture the knight because the pawn is pinned.
8
f8d6
4
k Black develops a piece, and threatens to take the pawn on h2 with check.
8
d1g4
4
k White's solution to the threat is a threat of his own.
8
k Black has no time for Bxh2+; here's why:
8
d6h2
4
g1h1
4
k Black must now move his bishop again, or white will play g3 and win the bishop.
8
h2d6
4
g4g7
4
k Black is now going to drop a rook.  Therefore, Black must find an alternate to 13...Bxh2+.
8
k Let's back up and find the right 13th move.
4
back 4
4
k Can you find Black's best move?
16
e8f8
4
k Black needs to guard the g-pawn.  This also gets the king out of the pin.
8
c1d2
4
k White doesn't have to move the attacked knight because if 14. exd5, 15. Qxd7 is a trade.
8
k Not to mention, it would be a trade favorable to White.
8
h7h5
4
k Here, Black attacks White's queen, and will try to open the h-file for his rook.
8
g4h3
4
k Of course, White must move his queen. He must also maintain the pin on black's e-pawn, or else black will play exd5, winning a piece.
8
g8h6
4
k Black plays this move for a number of reasons.
8
k One reason is to try to get white to take the h-pawn with the queen, and open the h-file.
8
k Another is perhaps to eventually post the knight on f5.
8
k It should also be noted that taking the knight with the bishop is by no means White's best move.
8
d5e3
4
k White wishes to relocate his knight. This also relieves the queen from the responsibility to keep the e-pawn pinned.
8
f8g8
4
k Black gets his king onto a safer square.
8
k Black's king now guards his rook as well, which will be important if white takes the h-pawn.
8
e3c4
4
k White attacks black's bishop and threatens to trade.
8
d6c7
4
k Black must keep his dark-squared bishop, or his threats on h2 are gone.
8
h3h5
4
k White finally takes the h-pawn.
8
h6f5
4
k The king move on move 16 makes this move possible.
8
k Black has now got the knight on a better square, and is also attacking White's queen.
8
h5g5
4
k This move is considered best.
8
c7h2
4
k Only now does Black take the h-pawn with check.
8
g1f1
4
k If 20. Kh1??, 20...Bf4+ wins White's queen, and the game!
8
d7b5
4
k This crucial yet excellent move ties White's pieces down.
8
k Now, if the knight moves, white wins the bishop with check since 21. Ne5 isn't possible.
8
k Also, if 21. Bxf5, 21...Bxc4+!! would win material for Black.
8
k Therefore, White's next move is necessary.
8
b2b3
4
k This move at least frees the bishop, for now the pawn guards the knight.
8
b8d8
4
k Black is now ready to trade queens.  His queen was in a somewhat inactive spot anyway.
8
k He also now threatens to play 22...Qxd3+ if white doesn't do something about it.
d3f5
4
k This move does 2 things.  It gets out of the threat of 22...Qxd3+, and it doubles Black's pawns.
8
e6f5
4
k Black, of course, must take back.
8
g5d8
4
k White can't take on f5.  If 23. Qxf5??, 23...Qxd2 wins the bishop.  The knight is pinned.
8
a8d8
4
k Of course, Black must take back.
8
d2c3
4
k Black was threatening 24...Rxd2, again because of the pinned knight.
8
b5a6
4
k Black keeps his bishop on that diagonal, but avoids harassment from moves like a4 by white.
8
a2a4
4
k White advances the pawn anyway.  This move is also useful because it prevents black's threat of b5, forcing the knight to move, followed by b4, a discovered check that would win white's bishop at c3.
20
h2c7
4
k Black puts the bishop on a better square, and threatens 26...Rh1+.
8
k Note that white is down a pawn, so trading pieces can't be good for white.
8
f1e2
4
k White tries to open up the back rank for his rooks, trying to get in Rh1 and take over the h-file.
8
h8h4
4
k This is an EXCELLENT move.
8
k White is already down a pawn.
4
k He will lose at least another pawn since he can't add another guard to the c4 square.
8
k Black's pieces are better placed.
4
k White's queenside rook isn't even developed, and his knight is pinned.
8
k Black also has the bishop pair.
8
k White also has no way to cover the e4-square, and the threat of ...Re4+ is also good for black.
8
k Overall, Black is winning (Neil McDonald & Andrew Harley give this position a -+).
15
k Well, this concludes my lecture on "Refuting the Milner-Barry Gambit."
5
k I hope all of you enjoyed it.
5
k And that all of you French Defenders can beat all of those that play the Milner-Barry Gambit!!!

k Good afternoon and welcome to 'Secrets of the Flank Attack.'
6
k This lecture is designed to give the viewer some interesting ideas on how to attack on the wings when the center becomes locked up.
13
k Since this topic is relevant only to closed openings (an oxymoron!?), it is safe to say that this lecture is written for players of an intermediate strength (1200-1600), as those below this range are probably interested in more 'popular' opening strategies such as those behind the Ruy Lopez and Sicilian Dragon, and those above this range are probably familiar with the themes that will be presented.  Not that players outside the range can't pick up anything, though :)
45
k Note: all games presented in this lecture come from OTB play.

k Black's other good options were 5...Be6 6.cxd with a Sicilian game, or 5...dxc 6.Qa4 with a reversed Pterodactyl.  5...e4, overextending, is a dubious way to play:

b1a3
k The formation taken in this game is that of the Czech Benoni (reversed). The focus of this instructive episode is the Benoni player's immediate plan of na3-c2,Bd2,Qe1,Rb1,a3, and then b4 to open the Q-side.  In this game his plan is contrasted with the crude K-side bludgeon of Black.
26
o-o
a3c2
c8g4
d1e1
k A crafty move, freeing the KN from its pin while hitting the square b4. Note this move was in White's plan anyway; it just happened to be a good move on the other side of the board as well! :)

d8d7
c1d2
a7a5
k To hold up White's b2-b4 advance.  It is a general rule that in positions with closed centers, the Knight Pawns (b or g) can be advanced to create tension on the wings.
16
a1b1
g4h3
k If 13.a3? then ...a4! ties White's hands, as b2-b4 will always be met with ...axb3 en passant.  So that rule is important, after all! :)

c5b4

k A disadvantage of the Na3-c2 Reti lines is that this Knight gets into play only by taking on b4 or using e1, a square which should be occupied by a major piece: the Queen in closed systems or the f-Rook in half-open systems.

14
d5d4
k Well timed.
d2d3
e6e5
e2e4
f8e7
k The center has become closed, and White begins Q-side play.  Note that b2-b3 is NOT a waste of time, as this move is often needed to keep Black from 'jamming' White (advancing a5-a4).  Black's e7-e6-e5, on the other hand, CAN be referred to as a waste of time.
24
b1a3
k We will see the same pattern that we saw White use in Game 2: Na3-c2,Bd2,Qe1,Rb1,a3,etc.

a7a5
k Black attempts to restrain White.

h2h3
k What!?? This is a horrible move that takes away all chances of an easy Q-side attack.  It was imperative for him to play a2-a3.  Black stuffs White in the following manner:
16
g4f3
g2f3
c6b4
k Stuffing the b-pawn!!
6
d2b4
k Another mistake!! White should take with the Nc2 (his worst placed piece at this moment) and then pry open the a-file with a2-a3.  After the text White may miss his good bishop.
17
a5b4
a2a3
b4a3
c2a3
d8b6
a3b5
k White's queenside is completely stuffed! Whatever will he do!?
6
f8d8
a1a4
k Trying to take the a-file.  If Black takes off the rooks, he will cure White's little problem on b3.
9
a8a6
e1d2
k It is easy to see White's plan has failed.  Thus, he reorganizes his forces. In closed games, time is not as critical as in the sharper openings, like, say, the Dragon.
16
d7b8
f3e2
k It looks like the long diagonal shall never become open again, so White relocates the 'modern' bishop, to a different post where it overprotects White's structure and...
16
b8c6
f2f4
k ...frees the f-pawn!! Now white grabs space on the other wing.
7

k Fine rook square, b5 is! :)
6
e5d6
k White has recovered from his opening errors, though he only has a minimal advantage.  The rest of this ending is long, drawn out, and filled with mutual error.  It is not important to the lecture and will not be included.
21
k What IS important, though, is seeing how White shifted his attack to the kingside when his queenside became stuffed in order to obtain acceptable play. Even though his K-side attack was not dangerous, it threw Black off-balance to the point where White was able to come back into the game (and eventually win a complex Bishop ending).

k Instructional Game 4- The Stock Kingside Attack
k Most of you, I bet, have heard of the King's Indian Defense.  This defense, as it seems, is notorious for half-closed positions with wild attacks on both wings.

k Black, in the meantime, will play for mate by storming the K-side.
6
c6e7
d1c2
k One of white's quieter 9th moves.  Black is out of his opening book now but can still play 'automatic' KID moves.
10
k These 'automatic' moves qualify as a 'Stock' attack, or a series of moves that can be played in a certain formation that the opponent cannot possibly prevent.  These moves are memorized before the game to save time, so that all the protagonist needs to think about during the game is the move order.
28
k Different players have different arsenals of 'Stock' attacks.  For example, some players will prefer playing a King's Indian with moves like ...Nd7(or e8),...f5-f4 while some players like the system with ...c6,...a5,...Na6(or d7)-c5.
k The former attack was played in this game:
26
f6d7
c1e3
f7f5
f3g5
k A trick! White threatens Ne6.  Note that this move would not be a great threat had Black played ...Ne8 instead of ...Nd7.  Some move orders are better than others, apparently! :)
17
d7f6

k Chicken! If white wanted to play the line like this, he should have followed up with the sac' on e6.  White's line is far too passive.

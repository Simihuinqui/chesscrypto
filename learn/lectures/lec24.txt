k This lecture is one in a series that will review the moves and ideas behind the King's Indian Attack (KIA). The KIA is a flexible opening system used by many of the world's top players including Fischer, Stein & Tal. It has been successfully played against the French, the Sicilian and the Caro-Kann. This opening lends itself to players who can't spend a great deal of time memorizing openings as White can reach the basic position regardless of what Black does.
55
k The KIA vs. other defenses.
8
k In this lecture we will be looking at 4 black formations.
6
k (1) KIA vs. a Queen's Indian formation.
k (2) A full KID with the colors reversed.
k (3) The symmetrical variation.
k (4) KIA vs. the Sicilian where Black plays ...d6.
5
k Let's start with the KIA vs. the Queen's Indian formation.

k There are many ways of getting into the KIA. Here white chooses to keep other options open.
9
c7c5
k Inviting a standard Sicilian after 2. e4.
5
g2g3
k Preparing to fianchetto the K-Bishop.
5
b7b6
k Heading for a Queen's Indian defense with ...b6 and ...Bb7.

k Preparing to castle.
c8b7
e1g1
k With the King safe, White will make his intentions on the center clear.
8
g8f6
d2d3
k Preparing e4.
6
d7d5
k Black is also fighting for the e4 square.
6
b1d2
k Still preparing e4.
6
e7e6
k Black decides to reinforce his strong point (d5).
6
e2e4
k In some ways this system resembles the KIA vs. the French. As we will see later many of the ideas involved in playing the KIA vs. the French are also valid against the QID.
17
f8e7
f1e1
k Protecting the valuable e4 pawn and preparing to push to e5.
7
b8c6
k Hitting the d4 square.
8
c2c3
k Keeping the Black Knight out of d4.
6
d5e4
k Black tries to ease the pressure by exchanging the e4 pawn. As we shall see, this doesn't work out as planned.
11
d3e4
k The Knight on d2 is shielding the Queen from being exchanged (as in the French).
8
e8g8
e4e5
k White plays e5 anyway. This effectively cuts Black's defenses in half.
7
f6d5
d1e2
k Overprotecting the e5 pawn.
6
a8c8
k Up to this point we have been following Henley-Browne, WBCA Caissa Memorial Blitz Tournament, 1992.
10
k We shall show the rest of the game so you can see how to follow White's plan through.

8

8

8
f1e1
k Now pressuring the e-pawn.
6
a8b8
k Getting off the long diagonal and preparing ...b5.

k Welcome to Knackie's Tactics Training. The examples are based on material of a Hungarian Chess School. They have been revised using Fritz and a bit of Knackie's brain.
15
k The 6th Lesson features the theme 'Mating attack'.
12
k In the previous Lessons, you've already encountered many mating combinations.
16
k In this Lesson we'll dive into the Mating-Attack theme for good. We will also view some more difficult examples.

1
k Let's start with an example of former World-Champion Spasski.
13
k White is a piece up, but black seems to have a threatening attack on the a-file.
16
k How did Spasski react?

25
f2f6
k nice sacrifice !!

e7f6
d4c5
k If black now answers Ke8, he is mated immediately by Rg8, so he tried:
15
f6e7
d1f1
f8e8
g1g8
e7f8
g8f8
k mate

k Example 2: Szabo vs Bakonyi, Budapest 1951

k In this example, white has two strong rooks on the h-file, but the black Bg7 seems to defend well.
19
k How did white break the defense?
9
k You get 50 seconds...
8
50
f4f6
k What a surprise!!
7
k Black must take the queen. Otherwise, he gets mated by: Rh8+ Bxh8 Rxh8 mate.
16
g7f6
g5f6
k The black king is enclosed! Rh8 mate cannot be prevented.
13
k Example 3: Barcza vs Trojanescu, 1951

k In this example, it seems hard to believe that white has an easy mate, as the Rg7 defends well.
18
k 60 seconds...
6
30
k note that the black Ra8 plays an important role in defending the 8th row...
30
h4h6
k white simply threatens Qxg7 mate.
9
k black cannot answer RxRg4 because of Qxh7 mate, so he must defend his rook..
15
a8g8
k It seems white has not achieved much, but there's a considerable difference between the black rook standing on a8 and g8...
21
h6h7
g7h7
g4g8
k mate

k Example 4: Adams vs Siminson, USA 1940

1
k The first move is surely not difficult to find here.
12
k But then, white must show very precise and forcing play, as black threatens both Qxa2+ and RxQ.
18
k 75 seconds...
6
g1g7
k Let's look what happens if the black king moves to h8 now:
13
g8h8
g7h7
h8g8
h7h8
k mate. That was easy!
8
back 4
k In the game black moved the king to f8 instead.
11
g8f8
k What now? Black still threatens Qxa2+ and RxQ, so white must continue to play forcing moves...
18
g7g8
f8g8
k White will now obviously give check on the g-file.
12
k What is best: Qg2+ or Rg1+ ?
9
30
d1g1
k Did you get it? The white queen is needed on e2 for preventing the black king from escaping via the e-file.
20
g8f8
k White now decisively improves the position of his Bd4.
12
d4g7
f8g8
k White now has a move 'for free' with his bishop g7, as the rook on g1 will give a discovered check.
19
k Which is the best position for the bishop to prepare a typical mating combination?
25
g7f6
g8f8
k Now follows a mating combination you should try to memorize, as it happens quite often:
17
g1g8
f8g8
k The black king steps on the deadly g-file again.
11
e2g2
g8f8
g2g7
k mate.

g2f3

12
h1h2
g3e3
e2f2
e3d3
k And so on.
10
back 8
k In the game White took on e4:
9
f3e4
g7g3
k In the game white now played Ra1, trying to chase the Queen. Let's look what happens if he tries to get rid of the Rg3 instead:
23
h1g1
k Can you find black's next shot?
20
a3a2
k Fantastic! White cannot take QxQ because of Re3 mate!
15
d2e1
k Now follows the nicest move of the combination:
20
b7b6
k Great!! After this little move black suddenly threatens Qa8 mate!
14
b1a1
k Now the Queen cannot go to a8, but...
15
a2a1
k the fun continues...
7
e1a1
g3e3
k mate!
8
back 8
k Now before looking at the game, let's see what happens if white tries to prevent Re3 by means of Rh-e1:
19
h1e1
k White seems to defend everything. How would you continue?
20
a3a8
k Incredible!!!  Black comes 'around the corner' to the other side of the board.
16
b1a1
a8g8
k White is helpless against the mating threats.
11
back 4
k In the game, white tried:
10
b1a1
a3b2
k Again, the black Queen cannot be taken because of Re3 mate.
13
k On the other hand, black threatens QxQ himself, followed by Re3 mate. There is no defense. White resigned.
19
k That's all folks, i hope you enjoyed the Lesson.

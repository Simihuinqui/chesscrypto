k This lecture is one in a series that will review the moves and ideas behind the King's Indian Attack (KIA). The KIA is a flexible opening system used by many of the world's top players including Fischer, Stein & Tal. It has been successfully played against the French, the Sicilian and the Caro-Kann. This opening lends itself to players who can't spend a great deal of time memorizing openings as White can reach the basic position regardless of what Black does.
44
k The KIA vs. the French
k Bobby Fischer played the KIA early in his career against both the French and Sicilian (after an early ...e6). White's plan is to establish a pawn on e5 effectively cutting Black's defenses off from the K-side and attack the dark squares around Black's king.
24
k Black's Plan is to attack on the Q-side with a pawn storm and distract White's K-side attack. The play for both sides tends to be very tactical.
14
e2e4
k Although the KIA can be reached by starting with 1.Nf3 it is more often reached after 1.e4. May e4 players use the KIA as an alternative to the semi-open games.
16
e7e6
d2d3
k By playing d3 (instead of d4) White has less space but more options. More importantly White is avoiding Black's opening preparation and playing the opening on his(her) terms.
17
d7d5
b1d2
k Protecting e4 and shielding the Queen from being exchanged in case of an exchange on e4.
9
g8f6
k Hitting the pawn on e4.
6
g1f3
k Attacking the important e5 square.
6
f8e7
k Preparing to castle.
6
g2g3
k The basic setup begins to show itself. The KIA is really nothing more than the King's Indian Defense with the colors reversed!
12
e8g8
k Getting the King to safety.
6
f1g2
k Getting the White squared Bishop on the long diagonal (h1 - a8).
6
c7c5
k Controlling the d4 square.
6
e1g1
b8c6
k Hitting d4 again.
6
e4e5
k Black's forces are now (effectively) cut in half. After an inevitable Nd7 White should support the e5 pawn and continue the attack on the dark squares around Black's king.
17
f6d7
k Hitting e5 again.
6
f1e1
k Supporting the e5 pawn. On ...Qc7, White has Qe2.
6
b7b5
k Here they come like a swarm of ants. Blacks pawns will flood the Q-side and attempt to open a file for Black's heavy pieces.
12
d2f1
k Getting the Q-Knight to the K-side via e3 or h2.
6
b5b4
h2h4
k A very important move in the KIA. White plays to control g5 (a dark square) and open up a square for the N on f1.
12
k The KIA can also be reached via the Sicilian move order.

k Here Black varies and fianchettos the K-Bishop.

g7g6
f1g2
f8g7
e1g1
g8e7
k Black play his K-Knight to a potentially more useful square. This allows the option of ...Nf5 hitting h4, e3 and protecting the sensitive h6 square.
15
k White's plan however, has not changed. Occupy e5 with a pawn and attack the dark squares around Black's King. Of course this means trading off the dark square Bishop.
22
f1e1
e8g8
e4e5
k ...Qc7 being met by Qe2
6
e7f5
k Occupying a key square. Black's setup is much more solid than in the French variation.

d2f1
k Planning to play Ne3, trading off Black's well placed Knight.
7
d8c7
k Now Qe2 gives Black Nd4 but White has another move...
7
c1f4
k This move prepares to exchange Black's dark square Bishop as well as protecting the critical e5 pawn.
10
k The best wasy to learn an opening is to play through some games.

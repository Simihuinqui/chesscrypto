k The French Defense has been used by every World Champion since Steinitz except Fischer.
10
k Black's main weakness in the French is the light-squared bishop.
8
k In the French, black usually looks for play on the queenside (since that is the direction that his central pawn chain points to).

k White's has other good options here,

k Black brings out his knight to add an attacker on the e4-pawn.
8
e4e5
k This move is the beginning to the Steinitz Variation.
8
k The other main option for white would be 4. Bg5 (the Classical Variation).
8
k However, the Classical Variation became somewhat unpopular for white after Korchnoj often won with the black pieces in the mid-1980s.

f6d7
k Black saves his knight and prepares to push c5 next.

k This solidifies the e5-pawn.  Otherwise, e5 could become very weak after black plays c5 and cxd4.

k Now both sides battle for the d4 square.

k He can either continue with 7...Qb6

8
k Let's take a little look at both of these options.

k This move aims to free the light-squared bishop.

k After 14. Qb3 or Bd3, white has a slight advantage.
10
k Let's go back and look at the other option, 7...cxd4.

k Welcome to Knackie's Tactics Training. The examples are based on material of an Hungarian Chess School. They have been revised using Fritz and a bit of Knackie's brain.
15
k The 5th Lesson features the theme 'Pulling the king to the open'.
10
k In most middlegames, both sides try to hide their their king behind a pawn shelter.
10
k Sometimes, however, the attacking side finds a way to break through the shelter, pulling the king to the open.
12
l Let's start with a typical example.

k White finally 'saves' his queen.
10
g7g6
e1e5
k After the black king is isolated, white is in no hurry chasing it with checks.
15
a5e5
k Black had no choice.
7
d4e5
k Considering material, black is almost ok: 2 Rooks + Bishop versus white's Queen + 3 Pawns.
10
k Considering the isolated black king, black is completely lost.
10
b7a8
e7f6
g6h7
f6f7

10
k Can you find the quick mate?
10
k White moves, 45 seconds ...
45
e5g4
k Kg7 now fails to Qh7 mate...
10
k and Ke7 fails to Qd6 mate.
10
k So, black must take the knight...
8
h5g4
g3e5
k Pulling the king further to the open.
10

10
k How did white exploit his superior position?
10
k White moves, 45 seconds...
45
f5f7
k Typically destroying the pawn shelter and pulling the king to the open.
12
g8f7

k White ensured that the black king can't escape. Now he starts thinking about mate.
10
k How would you continue the attack?
15
e4g6
c4c7
k Black narrowly defends against immediate mate. How does white increase the pressure?
20
d1e1
k After this powerful move, white threatens Qe8+ RxQe8 RxRe8 mate.
12
k The only defense against that mate would be Qd8, but that fails to Qf7 mate.
15

1
k At first sight, it might seem that the white king is more in danger than the black one.
12
k What's your opinion?
10
k White moves, 60 seconds...
60
h7g6
k A very bold method for pulling the king to the open.
10
f7g6
k Having played the queen sacrifice you must have seen all the following...
15
e2h5
g6h7
h5f7
g7h6
k Black found some shelter, but...
15
h1h6

k This is a much more 'calm' example.
10
k How did white pull the black king to the open?
10
k White moves, 45 seconds...
45
f1f6
k A calm move, but very strong. White simply threatens Qxh6.
12
k If black defends h6 by means of Rh8, white simply plays Ra-f1, when f7 cannot be protected.
15
k So, black has no choice: he must take the Rook.
10
g7f6
k the rest is simple:

k In this correspondence game, white worked out a brilliant finish.
12
k Can you calculate the variation through the end?
12
k White moves, 75 seconds...
75
f1f6
k That looks nice, but you must have calculated until the end.
e7f6
k How does white continue?
18
c3d5
k Kg7 now fails to the beautiful Bh6 mate, so black has no choice...
15
f6e6
k White would like to play Bxg4 here, but the black Queen protects g4. How does white continue?
18
h1h6
k f7-f6 now fails to Rxf6 mate, so black tries.
g8g6
k The black queen is now pinned, so white can play...
e2g4
f7f5

1
k Ex World-Champion Petrosian usually played slow strategical chess.
12
k This does not mean he was a bad tactician.
10
k Considering the previous examples, you'll probably guess the first move quickly. Do you also see move 3?
15
k White moves, 75 seconds...
75
f3f6
k Business as usual.
8
g7f6
d6e5
k Preventing the king from going back to g7.
10
k Black can play Kf5 or Kg5 here; let's first consider Kf5:
15
f6f5
k White now has a mate in 3 ...
20
e4f4
f5g5
e5f6
g5h5
f4h4
k mate; let's now go back to the game.
5
back 6
k Black tried Kg5 instead of Kf5.
8
f6g5
k This is the crucial point of Petrosian's combination:
10
k White is now faced with the problem of preventing the king from going back behind the pawn shelter.
15
k What was Petrosian's idea?
20
e5g7
k Extremely strong!! The bishop at g7 controls both the black king's escape squares: f6 and h6.
15
k The black king will soon be mated:
e7f5
h2h4
f5h4
g3h4
k On Kf5, Bh3 mate follows, so black tries:
g5h5
g2f3
k mate.
5
k You should remember this example, especially the move Bg7!!.
10
k Pulling the king to the open is not sufficient; you must ensure it stays there!

k Things are getting a bit more difficult now...
10
k The first move might seem obvious, but do you see all the complications?
15
k White moves, 75 seconds...
75
d5f7
k Everyone probably got that.
g8f7
f3d5
f7f8
k The next move should be easy...
15
f4d6
k Black now has the choice of Re7 or Be7; let's first consider Be7...
f6e7
k The next move is very typical...
12
e1e7
e8e7
k Can you find white's next move?
20
d5e6
k Very strong: white attacks both black rooks and prepares the following...
15
c8e8
k There follows of course...
10
d6e7
k Winning the Queen. Let's go back to the game.
10
back 6
k Black tried Re7 instead of Be7.
8
e8e7
k Which strong move now increases the pressure?
20
e1e6
k Preparing Rc-e1 and threatening Bxe7+, winning the Queen.
12
k Let's look what happens if black tries to save his Queen:
10
b6a7
e6f6
k White eliminates a vital defender.
8
g7f6
d5e6
k Attacking both Rooks.
c8e8
c1e1
k White now threatens Qxf6+ followed by taking on e7.
12
k Black is helpless, so let's go back to the game.
10
back 6
k Instead of Qa7 black tried the ingenius Rd8.
8
c8d8
k Black pins the Bishop at d6, but white nevertheless gets the better of it:
15
d6e7
f6e7
e6b6
d8d5
b6b2
k Two Rooks versus Rook + Bishop should be no problem. Black resigned.

k If you plan some sacrifices here, you must ensure the black king won't escape.
15
k White moves, 75 seconds...
75
e5f7
k The first sacrifice...
e8f7
c4e6
k The second sacrifice...
f7e6
k How would you prevent the black king from escaping?
20
d1b3

k mate.
5
k You might ask if one must calculate this whole 18-move variation on move 1? Of course not!
15
k You just need to ensure the king won't be able to go back behind his pawn shelter. The king won't survive in the long run.

k In this last example, white found a very imaginative way for using his Queen.
15
k White moves, 75 seconds...
75
e5f7
k QxQ does not help here, because white plays Nh6+ before recapturing the Queen.
15

k How does white prepare the decisive attack of his Queen ?
20

k Again, QxQ does not help because of Re7+.
10

20
f6f7

k White now finishes the game with a series of beautiful geometrical moves.

20
c7f4
k Threatening Qh6.
8
g6g5
k Which is the next Queen move ?
15
f4d4
k Threatening Qh8.
8
f8e7
k What is the final move?
20
d4c5
k f7-f8Q cannot be prevented. Black resigned.
15
k That final manoeuvre Qc7-f4-d4-c5 shows why chess can be considered an art.

{Checkmate the opponent

In this study, we're going to look at the endgame where one side has a Queen and the other side has a pawn on the 7th rank. We're going to look at the following situations:

1) Queen in front of the pawn = Win
2) Not a Bishop or Rook pawn = Win
3) Rook or Bishop pawn without King assistance = Draw
4) Rook or Bishop pawn with King assistance = Win

Let's start with a simple exercise to prove a first point: If the Queen can get in front of the pawn, the side with the Queen will win.

Win this game.}

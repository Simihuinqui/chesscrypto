{ PART 2 AVAILABLE HERE: https://lichess.org/study/ByFy31hm CHECKMATE PUZZLES AVAILABLE HERE: https://lichess.org/study/RdtICntn }
1. f3 { This study, the first in its series (the second part can be found at https://lichess.org/study/ByFy31hm), is a collection of beautiful chess studies, where the assignment is to force a win or a draw. In these puzzles there is only one, often elegant solution achieving this goal. For checkmating puzzles, where the assignment is to force mate within 2/3 moves, see https://lichess.org/study/RdtICntn. } 1... e5 { The puzzles/chapters are listed on the left hand side above the chat window, and are sorted alphabetically by the composers of these puzzles. Each chapter represents a different puzzle. The solution, as well as a detailed analysis of the variations crucial to the solutions, can be found on the right hand side after completing the puzzle and clicking "Analyse". } 2. g4 { If you like these puzzles or have any comments, feel free to drop a line in the chat box on the left, or add this study to your favorites by clicking the little heart ❤️ below the board when loading the study. And as mentioned, do not forget to check out the other puzzle collections at https://lichess.org/study/RdtICntn and https://lichess.org/study/ByFy31hm. } 2... Qh4# { As a sidenote, you might notice that some chapters have a *-mark, and some do not. Chapters without a * are fully annotated, with hints and guidance why other moves are wrong, while the chapters with a * are not quite fully annotated. (This is a rather time-consuming process.) } *

{ In this position white is up two pawns and a knight, but black is threatening to get a queen very soon. How does white win the game anyway? }
1. c3! { Correct! This pawn move covers two key squares (b4 and d4) and sets up an alternative way to win - if the pawn cannot be stopped, then maybe black can be checkmated. } 1... e1=Q { Black decides his best chance is to get a queen; both king moves would have allowed a knight check, after which the black pawn can be stopped. How does white proceed? } (1... Kc4 2. Ne3+ Kd3 3. Ng2 { And white will win. })  (1... Kb5 2. Nd4+ Kc4 3. Nxe2 { And white wins. }) 2. Nd6! { Correct! White completely traps the black king, and set up a deadly check with his b-pawn. Checkmate (or winning the queen) seems inevitable. } 2... Qxc3! { Black sees a tricky way to counter white's mating plan. How does white respond to this move? } (2... Qb1 3. b4+ Qxb4 4. cxb4+ { And the white e-pawn will decide the game. }) 3. Nb7+! { Correct! White does not fall for the stalemate trap (3. bxc3? is a draw!), and instead gives an intermediate check first. } (3. bxc3? { Stalemate! }) 3... Kd4+ { Black has no choice to move the king away from c5. What does white play next? } 4. bxc3+ { Correct! Only now does white capture the black queen, as there is no stalemate anymore. As black is not in time to win both white pawns, white will soon win the game. (1-0) } *

{ In this position, white is up a far-advanced a-pawn, but this pawn appears to be doomed. How does white convert this position into a win anyway? }
1. a8=R!! { Correct! White promotes his pawn to distract the black queen, without falling for any stalemate traps. } (1. a8=Q? Qd3+! 2. Qxd3 { And black saves the draw by stalemate! }) 1... Qxa8 { Black has no choice but to take the rook, as otherwise the white rook and queen will quickly checkmate black. How does white continue? } 2. Qb1+ { Correct! White forces the black king further to the edge of the board. } 2... Ka7 { Black tries to run his king to b8, to block the checks with his queen. This inaccuracy however allows white to finish the game quickly. How does white proceed? } (2... Ka6 3. Qa2+ Kb7 4. Qb3+ Kc8 5. Qc4+ Kb7 6.

White threatens mate, and the black queen is unable to hinder white with any spite checks. White will mate black in at most a few more moves. (1-0) } (3. Qa2+? Kb8 { And white can no longer win. }) *

{ In this position, both sides have pawns ready to promote, but while the black bishop is in time to stop the white pawn, the white knight appears to be too late to stop the black pawn on e2. How does white save a draw anyway? }
1. Ne5! { Correct! White prepares to cover the e1-square with the knight, forcing black's next move. } 1... e1=Q { Black gets his queen, and all seems hopeless for white. Can you find a way out? } (1... e1=R { This essentially leads to the same result. }) 2. f8=Q+! { Correct! White sacrifices his advanced pawn, again forcing black's reply. } (2. f8=R+ { This move also works, and transposes to the main line. }) 2... Bxf8 { Black's only move seems to have decided the game: white is now a full queen down. What does white play next? } 3. Nf7+ { Correct! White has one more free spite check with his knight, again leaving black no choice. } 3... Kg8 { The black king steps aside, and begs the question why white has not resigned yet. How does white continue? } 4. Nh6+ { Correct! White aims for a perpetual with Nf7-h6-f7, thereby forcing black to take to avoid a perpetual. } 4... Bxh6 { Unfortunately for black, taking on h6 leaves white in stalemate! (1/2-1/2) } (4... Kh8 5. Nf7+ Kg8 6. Nh6+ Bxh6) *

{ This seemingly innocent endgame holds quite a few hidden surprises. How does white navigate the tricks and traps in this position to quickly force black's resignation? }
1. e6+! { Correct! White avoids 1. Rh7+? Ke6! after which the black rook cannot be captured due to a stalemate. This move instead lifts the stalemate, and threatens to win the rook with a skewer on one of the next moves. } (1. Rh7+ Ke6 2. Rxa7 { And black is stalemated! } (2. Rh6+ Kf7 { This does not transpose back to the main line, as after 2. Rh6+ Kf7! white can no longer force a win. })) 1... Kd6 { Black sees that e.g. 1... Ke7? 2. Rh7+ now does lose a full rook, and takes cover behind the white pawn. How does white continue? } (1... Ke8 2. Rh8+ Ke7 3. Rh7+)  (1... Ke7 2. Rh7+) 2. e7+! { Correct! White would be happy to get rid of his e-pawn, as it would allow winning the black rook. } 2... Kd7 { Black again notices the danger of a rook check on h7, and again takes cover behind the white pawn. What does white play next? } (2... Kxe7 3. Rh7+) 3. e8=Q+! { Correct! White insists on black capturing the e-pawn, after which the king can be attacked by the white rook. } (3. Rh7 Ra4+ 4. Ke5 Ke8 { And black forced a draw. }) 3... Kxe8 { Black has no choice but to capture the queen. How does white proceed? } 4. Rh8+! { Correct! The black king is put in check, and cannot find a good square to hide. } 4... Kf7 { The black king charges at white's rook, but he is just too late. How does white decide black's fate? } 5. Rh7+! { Correct!

{ In this study, the question is not how this position was miraculously reached, but how white can save his pieces from the awkward positions they are in, and convert his material advantage to a win. What should white play? }
1. Re6+! { Correct! White sacrifices his rook, noting that the rook is poisoned for the f7-pawn due to the knight fork on g6. } 1... Kxe6 { Black has no choice but to capture with his king; all alternatives lead to a collapse even sooner. How should white continue? } (1... fxe6 2.

One of the points of the rook check was to lure the king to e6, so now the d-pawn can advance with tempo. } 2... Ke7 { Black has no choice, as the only alternative 2... Kd6 immediately loses to 3. Nxf7+. What should white play next? } (2... Kd6? 3. Nxf7+ { And white wins the black queen. }) 3. d6+! { Correct! The pawn marches up the board even further, using the fact that the black king has very few squares to hide. } 3... Ke8 { The black king wisely avoids taking the pawn, and sidesteps potential knight forks for now. How should white proceed? } (3... Kxd6 4. Nxf7+ { And white wins the black queen. })  (3... Kd8 4. Nxf7+ { And white wins the black queen. })  (3... Kf8 4. g6! { And black will soon lose his queen. })  (3... Ke6 4. Bf5+ Kxd6 5. Nxf7+ { And white wins the black queen. }) 4. d7+! { Correct! White keeps putting the black king in check, again using the fact that the black king is not quite feeling comfortable. } 4... Ke7 { The black king again sidesteps any direct knight forks, and moves to e7. What should white play now? } (4... Kd8 5. Nxf7+) 5. d8=Q+! { Correct! White yet again marches his pawn up the board, to get himself a queen. } 5... Qxd8 { Black must capture the queen, and taking with the king would fall for the by now well-known fork on f7. Taking with the queen therefore seems like the lesser evil, but how does white exploit this capture? } (5... Kxd8 6. Nxf7+) 6. Nc6+ { Correct! White finally found a way to fork the black king and queen, winning the queen and the game! (1-0) } *

{ White is currently up a queen for a rook and has a strong control over the light squares surrounding the black king. On the other hand, black has an unstoppable c-pawn, and after black gets a queen, the white king will not feel very safe either. How does white quickly score the full point? }
1. Bh7! { Correct! The bishop clears the way for the white queen, which threatens to infiltrate through the light squares. } 1... Rf8 { Black finds the most tenacious defense, covering f7 and preparing to hide the king in the corner. How should white continue? } (1...

The queen infiltrates, and the black king is driven to the corner. } 2... Kh8 $7 { Black's only move is a king retreat to the corner, but the black king now feels reasonably safe in this corner. How does white crack black's defensive setup? } 3. Bg8! { Correct! The white bishop again clears the way for the white queen, which now threatens mate in 1 on h7. } 3... Rxg8 { Black has no choice but to take the bishop, due to the mate threat on h7. How does white continue from here? } (3... c1=Q 4. Qh7#) 4. Kf7! { Correct! The king now infiltrates with deadly effect as well! The white queen is left en prise, but white has a backup plan to win in case the queen is lost. } 4...

This innocent pawn, originally on f5, now decides the game, as it is also unstoppable. } 5... c1=Q { Black cannot stop white's g-pawn, and decides to get a queen now that the action is over. How should white proceed? } 6. g7+ { Correct! The pawn advances with check, gaining a crucial tempo. } 6... Kh7 $7 { Black's only option is to play Kh7. How does white finish the game? } 7. g8=Q# { Correct! The f-pawn has become a queen and, together with the king, now decides the game in white's favor: black is checkmated! (1-0) } *

{ In this endgame we see white having a full rook more than black, but somehow white's king and rook are very awkwardly placed, while the black king threatens to gobble up the white queenside and advance his own queenside pawns. How does white refute black's ideas, and force a win? }
1. a4! { Correct! White offers a pawn trade, which would liquidate the entire queenside. } (1. Rg1? Kxb2 2. Rg5 Kxa2 3. Rxb5 a4 { And black will soon force a draw. })  (1. b4? axb4 2. Rg1 Kb2 3.

Rg3 { And black is unable to make a passed pawn. })  (1... bxa4? 2. Rxa4 Kxb2 3. Rxa5 { And white will easily win the KR vs. K endgame. }) 2. Ra3!! { Correct! This amazing move is all about gaining a tempo in the upcoming pawn race of white's b-pawn against black's a-pawn: white loses one move on making this additional rook move, while it costs black two additional moves to move the king from a3 to a1, after capturing the rook. Observe that 2. axb5? Kxa1 3. b6 a4 3. b7 a3 4. b8=Q a2 is a draw! } (2. axb5 Kxa1 3. b6 a4 4. b7 a3 5. b8=Q a2 { And black is just in time to save the draw! }) 2... Kxa3 { Black must capture the rook, as both pawn moves lose to 2... bxa4? 3. Rxa4 and 2... b4 3. Rg3 followed by 4. Rg5 and 5. Rxa5. What does white play next? } (2... b4 3. Rf3 b3 4. Rf5 Ka3 5. Rxa5 b2 6. Rb5 { And white wins. }) 3. axb5 { Correct! White now enters the pawn race with his b-pawn, knowing that black will be just one move short. } 3... a4 { Black advances his pawn. What does white play? } 4. b6 { Correct! White advances his pawn as well, hoping to get to the other side sooner than black. } 4... Ka2 { Black needs to move his king to make way for his a-pawn, losing an important tempo. What does white play? } 5. b7 { Correct! White marches his pawn up the board, and almost has a new queen. } 5... a3 { Black advances his pawn as well. What does white play? } 6. b8=Q { Correct! Although black has an advanced a-pawn, his pawn is not yet advanced far enough up the board to force a draw; black would need two moves to play Ka1 and a2, and unfortunately he only has one move. (1-0) [An example line: 6... Ka1 7. Qe5+ Kb1 8. Qe1+ Kb2 9. Qb4+ Ka2 10. Kg7 Ka1 11. Qxa3+ and white wins.] } *

{ In this magnificent study by famous chess player and composer Pal Benko, both sides have two rooks, but black's pieces are not very well coordinated. Can white combine threats of checkmate and skewers to win the game? }
1. O-O-O! { Correct! White prevents that black frees up his rooks with tempo (checks), and continues putting pressure on the black position. } 1... Rf8 { Black sees that he cannot move either rook from the back rank, as then the other rook will be lost to a skewer by the a7-rook. Instead, black prepares a (slow) way to untangle. How should white continue? } (1... Rg5 2. Ra8+)  (1... Rh6 2. Re1+ Kf8 3. Rf1+ Ke8 4. Ra8+) 2. Kb1! { Correct! White cannot yet exploit black's position yet, and improves the position of his king, clearing more squares for the d1-rook. } 2... Rhg8 { Black pulls his other rook closer to the king, and is now ready to move the rook from f8 along the f-file. What should white play? } (2... Rh6 3. Re1+ Kd8 4. Ra8+) 3. Ka1! { Correct! This remarkable maneuver further increases the pressure on black's position, by also clearing the b1-square for the rook on d1. } (3. Rc1? Kd8 $10) 3... Rf6 { Black can finally remove one of his rooks from the back rank, without losing a rook to a skewer. How does white win anyway? } (3... Rf7 4. Ra8+) 4. Rb1! { Correct! As the a7-rook alone cannot win material with a skewer, white now sets up a mate threat on b8 using the other rook. } (4. Ra8+? Kf7 5. Rd7+ Ke6 $10) 4... Rd6 { Black's only defense against the mate is blocking the check with his own rook. What should white play now? } 5. Rb8+! { Correct! White delivers check anyway, forcing black's reply. } 5... Rd8 $7 { Black has no choice but to put his rook on d8, blocking the check. What does white play? } 6. Rxd8+ { Correct! White trades on d8, luring the black king to d8 and further away from the protection of the other rook. } 6... Kxd8 $7 { Black has no choice but to recapture. How does white finally finish the game? } 7. Ra8+ { Correct! After a long buildup, with many threats of mate and back-rank skewers, this skewer finally decides the game by winning a full rook.

Moreover, the black knights are hanging, and the black king has been cornered, making this seem like an easy win. However, things are not as simple as they seem, as black has some stalemate tricks up his sleeve. How does white win anyway? }

Qxb6 { Taking the knight allows white to get a queen of his own. } 2. e8=Q+) 2. Nd5! { Correct! White saves the knight and pawn, and gains a tempo on the black queen. } (2.

Qe6 { Black had no immediate way to checkmate white, and therefore decided to pin the white knight (preventing any knight jumps), while still covering the e8-square to stop white from getting a queen. How does white force a draw anyway? } (2... Qa7+ { This check does not solve black's problems. } 3. Kb1! Qg1+ 4. Ka2! { And black has no choice but to accept the draw soon. }) 3. e8=Q+! { Correct! White sacrifices his pawn, to unpin the knight and set up a devastating fork. } (3. Kb2? Kc5 { And black will soon win the pawn on e7. }) 3... Qxe8 { How does white finally make use of the awkward positioning of the black major pieces? } 4. Nc7+ { Correct! White sacrificed his pawn to win the black queen with his last remaining piece: his knight. (1/2-1/2) } *

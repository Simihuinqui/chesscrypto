{In this Study, we're going to look at Rook endgames where both sides have a Rook, but one side has a pawn on the 7th-rank and their Rook is passive, or "trapped", in front of the pawn.

If Black's King is on any of the red squares when it's White to move, this position is a draw.

With Black's King on b6 or b7, Black will simply capture the pawn on the next move.

With Black's King on c6 or c7, Black will play Kb7 on the next move and be able to either capture the pawn or occupy the promotion square by playing Ka8.

With Black's King on a1, a2, or a6, it's impossible for White to move their Rook away from the promotion square with tempo as no checks are available. White either has to move their Rook and lose the pawn, or move their King. The White King has nowhere to hide, so black can just check White forever.

If the black King is on any square other than the red squares, it is a win for White.

With Black's King on d7, e7 or f7, White can play Rh8. Black can't respond with Rxa7 due to Rh7+, winning the rook on a7. The best Black can do is to delay the eventual loss.

With Black's King on any other square not mentioned, White can move their Rook away from the promotion square with a check and promote their pawn on the next move.

Since the Black king is not on one of the red squares, we know this is a win for White. Let's win this game by playing the only winning move . }

To draw this position as Black we keep our King on g7 or h7, and we keep our Rook on the promotion file whenever we can. If White moves their King next to their pawn we have to check it away.

Right now, White isn't threatening anything, so we can just shuffle our King between g7 and h7. }

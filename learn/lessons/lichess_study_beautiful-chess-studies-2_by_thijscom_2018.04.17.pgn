{ PART 1 AVAILABLE HERE: https://lichess.org/study/iDSPaPWA CHECKMATE PUZZLES AVAILABLE HERE: https://lichess.org/study/RdtICntn }
1. f3 { This study, the second in its series (the first part can be found at https://lichess.org/study/iDSPaPWA), is a collection of beautiful chess studies, where the assignment is to force a win or a draw. In these puzzles there is only one, often elegant solution achieving this goal. For checkmating puzzles, where the assignment is to force mate within 2/3 moves, see https://lichess.org/study/RdtICntn. } 1... e5 { The puzzles/chapters are listed on the left hand side above the chat window, and are sorted alphabetically by the composers of these puzzles. Each chapter represents a different puzzle. The solution, as well as a detailed analysis of the variations crucial to the solutions, can be found on the right hand side after completing the puzzle and clicking "Analyse". } 2. g4 { If you like these puzzles or have any comments, feel free to drop a line in the chat box on the left, or add this study to your favorites by clicking the little heart ❤️ below the board when loading the study. And as mentioned, do not forget to check out the other puzzle collections at https://lichess.org/study/iDSPaPWA and https://lichess.org/study/RdtICntn. } 2... Qh4# { As a sidenote, you might notice that some chapters have a *-mark, and some do not. Chapters without a * are fully annotated, with hints and guidance why other moves are wrong, while the chapters with a * are not quite fully annotated. (This is a rather time-consuming process.) } *

{ In this position, white is down a queen for a knight and two pawns. On the other hand, the black pieces are awkwardly placed on the back rank, and the black pieces have very few squares to move to. How does white use this to quickly force a draw? }
1. Nf6+! { Correct! White gives a check, further restricting the black queen, and forcing the black king to move from e8. } 1... Kd8 { As 1... Ke7? 2. Ng6+ immediately loses the queen, black decides that 1... Kd8 is his best chance. How does white continue? } (1... Ke7 2. Ng6+) 2. e7+! { Correct! The king and queen are forked by the pawn, and the knight on e5 threatens to deliver a fork on the next move if either piece captures on e7. } 2... Nxe7 { Black therefore captures on e7 with his knight, avoiding the loss of his queen. This however further restricts the black queen. What does white play next? } (2... Qxe7 3. Nc6+)  (2... Kxe7 3. Ng6+) 3. Kb7!! { Correct! This amazing, quiet move shows the helplessness of black's position, despite the considerable material advantage. Black's king is trapped, the knight cannot move due to a checkmate on c6, and the queen is struggling to find any safe squares to move to. } 3... Qg7 { Black finds the only move that does not immediately lose the queen (or loses to checkmate). What does white play next? } (3... Qh8? 4. Nf7#)  (3... Nf5? { (or any other knight move) } 4. Nc6#) 4. Kb8!! { Correct! Although white cannot yet exploit the positioning of black's pieces, this king move again demonstrates the helplessness of black's position. } 4... Qf8 { Black again has no good options, and decides to move the queen back to f8. What does white play next? } (4... Qxg5? 5. Nf7#)  (4... Qh8? 5. Nf7#)  (4... Nd5? { (or any other knight move) } 5. Nc6#) 5. Kb7! { Correct! If black does not try to win, white cannot force a win, and with best play by both sides we will soon reach a three-fold repetition. (1/2-1/2) } *

{ In this study, white has a dangerous advanced c-pawn (threatening to become a queen in two moves), but white also has an awkwardly placed king, vulnerable to mating attacks on the first rank. Can you find a way for white to win? }
1. Rd6! { Correct! This particular rook move is the only winning move, as will become apparent soon. } (1. Rh7+? Kb6 2. c7 Ra8 { And black holds the draw. })  (1. c7?? Rxh6 2. c8=Q Rh1+ { And black wins! })  (1. Kb1? Rb6+ 2. Kc1 Kb8 { And black makes a draw. }) 1... Rb6 { Black decides to improve his rook slightly, threatening to play Ka7-b8-c7 next.

Rxa6 Kxa6 4. c8=Q+ { And white wins. }) 2. c7! { Correct! With the white rook on d6, the time is now right to advance the pawn. } 2... Rxd6 { As black cannot both stop the pawn and save his own rook, he decides to capture white's rook, threatening mate on d1. How does white continue? } (2... Kb7 3. Rxb6+ Kxb6 4. c8=Q { And white also wins. }) 3. c8=N+! { Correct! This promotion to a knight forks the king and rook, preventing black's checkmating plans. Soon white will not only capture black's rook, but also black's two a-pawns, after which the white a-pawn will decide the game. (1-0) } *

{ This somewhat artificial position sees white down a full rook(!), but whereas black's pawns are currently blocked by the black king, white's three pawns are all close to promotion. Your assignment: white to play and win! }
1. Re1!! { Correct! Black's rooks are overloaded with protecting against promotion and defending each other, and this rook move nicely exploits this vulnerability. } 1... Rb2+ { Either way of taking the rook is fatal, so black decides to give a check. What should white play? } (1... Rfxe1 2. b8=Q+ Rxb8 (2... Kxd7 3. Qxb1 Rxb1 4. f8=Q $18) 3. f8=Q+ Kxd7 4.

Kxa3 { Correct! White cannot retreat to a1, as that would immediately lead to checkmate in one after Rxe1. } 2... Rff2 { Black still cannot capture the rook, and reinstates his two-rooks construction. How does white continue? } (2... Rb3+ 3. Kxa4 Rb4+ 4. Kxa5 Rff4 5. Re4 { This transposes to the main line. }) 3. Re2! { Correct! The black rooks are still overloaded, and this move breaks up the harmony between the black rooks again! } 3... Rb3+ { Black recognizes that the rook is still poisoned, and decides to side-step the rook again with a check. What should white play next? } 4. Kxa4 { Correct! White again undermines the rook on b3, renewing the threat on both rooks. } 4... Rff3 { Black yet again reinstates his defensive mechanism of two defending rooks. How should white proceed? } 5. Re3! { Correct! White repeats the same method of breaking apart the black fortress, by interposing his own rook between black's two rooks. } 5... Rb4+ { Black once more delivers a check on b4, using his last remaining a-pawn for support. How does white continue? } 6. Kxa5 { Correct! White captures the last black a-pawn, renewing the threat on both black rooks. } 6... Rff4 { Black defends both rooks once more, using the same mechanic as before. What should white play? } 7. Re4! { Correct! White interposes his rook one last time, and this time black has no escape anymore. Regardless of black's reply, white will be able to convert to an easily winning endgame. (1-0) } *

{ Here we have a position where white has a rook (and two doubled pawns) for two knights, which is usually not enough to win. Can you find a way to exploit the awkward position of black's pieces to force a white victory? }
1. Rh4! { Correct! White attacks one of black's knights, which has a very hard time finding a good square to hide. } 1... Nf7 { Black plays the only move that does not immediately lose a knight to a pin on the fifth or eighth rank. How does white continue putting pressure on black's position? } (1... Ng8 2. Rh8)  (1...

The white rook now attacks the other black knight, which is stuck in the corner. } 3... Nb6 { The other black knight also finds shelter around the black king, and black is pretty confident now that he will not be losing either of his knights soon. Is he right, or can white still force a win? } 4. Rc7# { Correct! The black knights may be safe, but the king is now checkmated in the center of the board! (1-0) } *

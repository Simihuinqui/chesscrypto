{In this Study, we will look at how to checkmate a lone King with a Knight and Bishop.

The first thing to note, is that we can only checkmate the King in the corner of the board which is the same color as our Bishop, which in this example is a8 and h1. If we had a dark squared Bishop, we could only checkmate Black on a1 or h8.

Black will therefore try to stay in the center of the board, and if they can't, then they will move towards the "wrong" corner, meaning a corner in which we can't checkmate the King.

White however, wants to force Black's King to a8 or h1. To accomplish this, there are two well-known methods that can be used. One is called "Del√©tang's triangle method" and the other is called "the W method". You only have to know one of these methods. In this Study, we will learn the first one.

The basic idea is to restrict Black's King to smaller and smaller areas of the board.

The first step is to restrict Black's King to one of the green triangles we see on the board in this position. We will control the long diagonal of the triangle with our Bishop, and we will control the necessary dark squares using our Knight and King.

Move your King closer to the center to read about step 2 in the overall plan. }

{KBN vs K is a fairly rare endgame. A 2001 study showed that it happens it about 0.02% of games. Even so, it can be useful to study because the technique is hard to find OTB as this game shows.

This game took place in Geneva, Switzerland in 2013. It was Round 4 in a FIDE Women Grand Prix tournament. The Women's World Chess Champion, Anna Ushenina, failed to mate with Knight and Bishop and her opponent claimed a draw due to the 50 move rule.

The relevant part of the game starts at 72. Nxc3. Scroll through the moves and watch the video below. Move on to the next chapter when you're ready.

{ The name of this pattern is attributed to Polish master Dawid Janowski referring to coupled rooks on a player's 7th rank as swine. For this type of mate, the rooks on white's 7th rank can start out on any two of the files from a to e, and although black pawns are commonly present, they are not necessary to effect the mate. }

{ Smothered Mate occurs when a knight checkmates a king that is smothered (surrounded) by his friendly pieces and he has nowhere to move nor is there any way to capture the knight. It is also known as "Philidor's Legacy" after François-André Danican Philidor, though its documentation predates Philidor by several hundred years. }

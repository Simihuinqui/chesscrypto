{ When trying to checkmate with two bishops, there are two important principles to follow. One, the bishops are best when they are near the center of the board and on adjacent diagonals. This cuts off the opposing king. Two, the king must be used aggressively, in conjunction with the bishops.

Mate in 13 if played perfectly. }

[SetUp "1"]

{ Of the basic checkmates, this is the most difficult one to force, because the knight and bishop cannot form a linear barrier to the enemy king from a distance. The checkmate can be forced only in a corner that the bishop controls. The mating process often requires accurate play, since a few errors could result in a draw either by the fifty-move rule or stalemate.

Mate in 10 if played perfectly. }

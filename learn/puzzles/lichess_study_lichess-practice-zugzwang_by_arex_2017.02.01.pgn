{ The word Zugzwang comes from German and means 'being forced to make a move'. A player is in Zugzwang when it's their turn and any move they can make is a bad move. Can you find the move that will put black in Zugzwang and force mate in 2?

This is a composition by Paul Morphy, originally published in the New York Clipper on June 28, 1856. }

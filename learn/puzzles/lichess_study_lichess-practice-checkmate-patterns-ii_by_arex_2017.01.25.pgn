{ Damiano's Mate is a classic method of checkmating and one of the oldest. It works by confining the king with a pawn or bishop and using a queen to initiate the final blow. Damiano's mate is often arrived at by first sacrificing a rook on the h-file, then checking the king with the queen on the h-file, and then moving in for the mate. The checkmate was first published by Pedro Damiano in 1512. }

{ A piece is Overloaded (also known as "overworked") if it has more than one responsibility, e.g. defending a piece, defending a square, blocking a check, and blockading a piece. In this example, the f7 pawn has at least two responsibilities; it is protecting the bishop on e6, but it is also protecting the knight on g6. Can you exploit this double responsibility? }

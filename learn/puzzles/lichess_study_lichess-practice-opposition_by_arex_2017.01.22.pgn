{ Direct Opposition is a position in which the kings are on the same rank or file and they are separated by one square. In such a situation, the player not having to move is said to "have the opposition". The side without the opposition may have to move the king away, potentially allowing the opposing king access to important squares. Take the opposition to reach a key square and win! }

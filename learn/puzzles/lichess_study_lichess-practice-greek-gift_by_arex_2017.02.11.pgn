{ The Greek Gift sacrifice is a common tactical theme, where one side sacrifices their bishop by capturing the rook pawn of a castled king position (white playing Bxh7+ or black playing Bxh2+) usually in order to checkmate the opponent or gain significant material advantage.

Play the Greek Gift sacrifice and maintain a winning position for 4 moves to complete this exercise. }

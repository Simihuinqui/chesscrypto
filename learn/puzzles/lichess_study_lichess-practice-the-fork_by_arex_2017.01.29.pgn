{ A fork is often also called a double attack, because it usually attacks two targets. A fork can of course attack more than two targets, and the targets don't have to be pieces. Direct mating threats, or even an implied threat can also be excellent targets for a fork.

In this position, you can fork an undefended piece and a second implied threat. }

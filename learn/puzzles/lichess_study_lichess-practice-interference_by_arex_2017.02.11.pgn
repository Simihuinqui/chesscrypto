{ Interference occurs when the line between an attacked piece and its defender is interrupted by sacrificially interposing a piece - typically on a protected square.

In this position, Black threatens mate on e2, but White's queen is protecting that square. Can you make a bishop move to interfere with this defense?

From Adolf Jay Fink - Alexander Alekhine, 1932. }
